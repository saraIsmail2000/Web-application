Web-application
This web application was made for a charitable purpose. It records the data of a family that have financial issues so that the charity can support them later on , with money , clothes , medicine etc..

The Beneficiary's(head of a family) info are inserted by the user(like an employee) as well as the whole family's info (job info if any , address info , wife's info if married , children info if any , loans , belongings etc..) Beside that , he can edit a certain information of his family whenever he wants.

After recording all family information , the application's job is to set a rate for every single family , called the total rate , that is based on other rates of the family (like grades) such as number of workers , family members , number of students etc. And the family with less rate is the poorest one so that it needs help more than others as soon as possible.

This web application is built with ASP .net core MVC , c# and Entity Frame Work, using Visual Studio 2019 community version.
